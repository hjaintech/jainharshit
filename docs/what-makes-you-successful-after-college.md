# What makes you successful in the industry?

From school to college, your "success" depends on how good you can study a few subjects and how many marks you score in the exams.

Once you get into the industry, success no longer depends on just your technical skills.

This comes as a shock to a lot of people

Your success also depends on how good are you with life skills.

By life skills, I am not talking about swimming kind of skills.

But things like

- Do you know how to negotiate with others
- Do you have a positive attitude?
- Do you know how to collaborate with others?
- Do you know how to establish & maintain relationships with others?
- Do you know how to communicate effectively?

This is a nudge for you to think about how good are you at life skills and how you can improveüëç
