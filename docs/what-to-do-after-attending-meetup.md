# What to do after attending a meetup/conference?

Over the last few days, my Twitter feed was full of posts about different meetups/conferences that happened recently including React India.

I am sure everyone enjoyed it to the fullest.

But now what?

My nudge to you is to not treat it as just a fun event. Give yourself and your time the deserved respect.

You spent a considerable amount of your time getting exposed to a lot of folks and a lot of new ideas, concepts, and technologies.

It's time for taking the next step

I urge you to look back and go through the list of new tech stuff that you saw/heard there.

Choose at least one of them that you think is worth it and double down on it.

Well, how?

ðŸ“Œ Learn more about it
ðŸ“Œ Get your hands dirty
ðŸ“Œ Deploy a tiny implementation
ðŸ“Œ Write a blog on it
ðŸ“Œ Try to use it at work

And the craziest dare - Learn it enough to give a talk on that topic at the next meet-up near you.

I'd consider the 20 minutes it took me to write this tweet worthwhile if even 1 person ended up doing any of the above in the next month or so.

P.S. If you do, please don't forget to tell me about it. I'll be waiting!
